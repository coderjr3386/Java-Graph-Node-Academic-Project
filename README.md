GraphAnalyser uses a BasicGraph to represent and process a graph of Twitter
users and the follow connections between users. Nodes in our graph will be 
user names and an edge from user1 to user2 will be used to represent the 
connection "user2 follows user1".

To demonstrate this application, simply run "java GraphAnalyser fileName" where fileName is a sample inuput file.
